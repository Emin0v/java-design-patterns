## Prototype Pattern

Prototype Pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.

_**Advantage of Prototype Pattern**_

* It reduces the need of sub-classing.
* It hides complexities of creating objects.
* The clients can get new objects without knowing which type of object it will be.
* It lets you add or remove objects at runtime.
