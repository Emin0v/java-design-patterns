## Facade Pattern

A Facade Pattern says that just "just provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, therefore it hides the complexities of the subsystem from the client".

**_Advantage of Facade Pattern_**

* It shields the clients from the complexities of the sub-system components.
* It promotes loose coupling between subsystems and its clients.
